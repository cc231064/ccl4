Tectonic Pets

Storyline: Blorbo is taking care of her animals by changing tectonic plates. You are helping Blorbo in achieving her Goal by adding animals onto the planet and changing Biomes.   

Features: The Player takes the animals, biomes and trees out of their inventory and adds them to the planet. 

System design: Blorbo will mostly fly around the tectonic plates and observe them. If there was to be a bigger change, Blorbo will fly up the screen and talk to the player to explain the changes. Depending on the changes, Blorbo will have different reactions and expressions.  

Passive animations such as sheep, chickens, goats etc. will react scared to aggressive animals such as foxes and wolves.
